When we talk about “The Stack”, we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases.



The Jamstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.



Pre-rendered sites can be enhanced with JavaScript and the growing capabilities of browsers and services available via APIs.
